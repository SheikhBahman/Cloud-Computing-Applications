# Introduction
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of human genetic data and related ongoing researches to find genomics variants of
genetic disorders for diagnostic purposes are bringing about groundbreaking advances in the healthcare, medical and pharmaceutical
fields. Publicly accessible and constantly updated variant databases that host genetic variant data are often the primary source of pathogenic variant data used by researchers for clinical diagnosis.
In the past, it was not easy for users of genetic data to analyze and derive insights from their data sets, thanks to the enormous size of the genome sequences and complexity of the DNA data sets that they need to analyze. In the 21st century, distributed computing and high performance multi variant cloud computing capabilities and services offered by sophisticated cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services(AWS) have opened up a whole new realm for such researchers who deal with complex genetic data sets on a day to day basis.
